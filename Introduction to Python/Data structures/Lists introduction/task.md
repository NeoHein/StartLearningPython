<h2>Lists introduction</h2><p>A list is a data structure you can use to store a collection of different pieces of information under a single variable name. A list can be written as an array of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets, e.g. <code>lst = [item1, item2]</code> . Lists might contain items of different types, but usually all the items in the list are of the same type. Like strings, lists can be indexed and sliced (see <a href="#lesson3#task3#" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Lesson 3</a>).</p><p>Use list slicing to print <code>[4, 9, 16]</code> .</p><div class="hint">Use list slicing lst[index1:index2]</div>
