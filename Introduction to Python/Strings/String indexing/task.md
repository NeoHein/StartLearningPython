<h2>String indexing</h2><p>You can access a character of a string if you know its position. For example, <code>str[index]</code> will yield the character at position <code>index</code> in the string <code>str</code> .<br>
Note that string index always starts at <code>0</code> .<br>
Indices may also be negative numbers, to start counting from the right. Note that since <code>-0</code> is the same as <code>0</code> , negative indices start from <code>-1</code> .</p><p>Use index operator to get <code>"P"</code> from <code>"python"</code> .</p><div class="hint">Note that index starts with 0.</div>
