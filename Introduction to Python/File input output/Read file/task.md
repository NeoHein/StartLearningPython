<h2>Read file</h2><p>Python has a number of built-in functions to read and write information from a file on your computer. The <code>open</code> function is used to open a file. The file can be opened in read mode (using <code>"r"</code> as the second argument) or in write mode (using <code>"w"</code> as the second argument). The <code>open</code> function returns the file object. You need to store it to close the file later.</p><p>Print the contents of "input.txt" to output. Print the first line of "input1.txt".
